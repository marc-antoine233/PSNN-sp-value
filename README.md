## data file description

The file [Case 4 sp values.cs](./Case%204%20sp%20values.csv) includes all 20 sets of specialized function coefficients used in Case 4 of this paper.

The first line represents the names of coefficients, formatted as `alpha^k_(i,j)`, where $k$ denotes the region index, $i$ and $j$ represent the order of $x$ and $y$, respectively.

The subsequent lines contain 20 sets of coefficient values used in the specialized layer.
